Deep learning models reported in this work were built using PyTorch library v1.7.1 (Meta AI). The custom codes were written in Python v3.6.9. Dependent packages include Numpy v1.16.4, Nibabel v3.2.1, mpi4py v3.0.3, and blobfile v0.11.0. Statistical testings were performed using MATLAB (R2023b). PET image reconstructions were performed using clinical software provided by Siemens Healthineers and United Imaging Healthcare.
